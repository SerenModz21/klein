# klein
Blazing fast URL shortener made with simplicity in mind

# Structures
The project is what people would call a "monolith".
You can find the backend in the `server` folder and the frontend in the `client` folder.  (Which I still haven't made so wait a while x1)

# Run
As easy as filling out config/config.yaml and running it.
Remember to have a Mongo and Redis instance running.
I suggest using Docker, though. (Which I still haven't made so wait a while x2)

# Testing
I'm too lazy to write tests for now but you can use the `Insomnia.yaml` file to quickly test the RESTful API!
