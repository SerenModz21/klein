# klein
Blazing fast URL shortener made with simplicity in mind

# Structures
The project is what people would call a "monolith".
You can find the backend in the `server` folder and the frontend in the `client` folder.

# Run
As easy as filling out config/config.yaml and running it.
Remember to create the urls collection in the mongo database.
I suggest using Docker, though.
