# klein
Blazing fast URL shortener made with simplicity in mind

# Run
As easy as filling out config/config.yaml and running `make`. Of course, you need to have the necessary dependencies, and remember to have a Mongo and Redis instance running.
I suggest running it with docker though, it's as easy as running `docker-compose up -d`

# Testing
I'm too lazy to write tests for now but you can use the `Insomnia.yaml` file to quickly test the RESTful API!
